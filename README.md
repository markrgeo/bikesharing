Deliverable 3: Challenge Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 
The analysis of data for the NYC CitiBike program was intended to give insights into how customers and subscribers of that company used the bike sharing service to see if it could be replicated in the city of Des Moines. 

This data demonstrated that in New York City, the ridership was predominantly males. The users of the service were most highly concentrated in the Manhattan district. We also found that the customers tended toward being young adults. 

We also looked at details about when in a day there is the most use of this service and found that the weekday ‘rush-hour’ periods were when usage peaked. This tells us that people are primarily looking at this as a service that assists them in purposeful travel rather than using it for more leisurely rides. These facts will help with successfully structuring a similar program else where, as we have a good basis for what is required to appeal to potential customers.


Results: 

1. Checkout Times for Users.png
1.	This line graph is displaying the number of bikes and duration of time bikes were checked out by CitiBike customers.

2. Checkout Times by Gender.png
2.	This line graph is displaying the number of bikes and duration that people of different genders would have a bike checked out for.

3. Breakdown by Gender.png
3.	This pie graph demonstrates the CitiBike customers based on their gender.

4. Top Starting Location.png
4.	This is a symbol map that illustrates where bikes are being signed out from. The circles vary in size and colour based on the popularity of a given location to get a bike from. The larger and darker a circle, the more common it is for bikes to be used starting in those locations.

5. Trips by Weekday by Hour.png
5.	This heat map shows days of the week and hours of the day, and the coloured blocks indicate when the busiest periods are. The darker the block, the more active those times are. 

6. Trips by Gender.png
6.	This heat map tells a similar story to the last one, illustrating when the most bikes are being used, however this goes one step further and differentiates the busiest times by the gender of the person using the bikes.

7. Trips by Weekday.png
7.	This last heat map again compares people of different genders and which days they are most commonly using a CitiBike. The heat map also compares individuals who subscribe for the bike sharing service, and customers who use the bikes without a subscription. Again, the darker the block, the more active individuals of these genders and groups are.


Summary: 

These details tell us how we can translate this model from New York City to Des Moines and make a sustainable business of this. Seeing that NYC has a core customer base that have subscribed to the service, and primarily use their CitiBike for traveling to and from work we can attempt to rely on a similar base of users in Des Moines. 

There may be differences in population numbers between these two cities which will mean we have to adjust the number of bikes fords Moines. Further data analysis of the two cities, and a comparison between New York City’s population to subscribers of CitiBike could be used as a template for how many riders can be expected in Des Moines. They can also draw comparisons between users and the number of bikes there are in New York, and how any bikes they will need in Des Moines.

The disparity between male and female customers is another topic that requires further research. CitiBike may have some potential to boost their customer base if they can determine why females are less likely to subscribe to their service. If they can do that, and work to find solutions to potential problems they may increase their over-all users. The methods they employ in doing this could then be replicated to try to become more appealing to other groups of people for example older individuals, and in doing so may also increase more recreational use of bikes among the population of retired people. The data around the ages and gender of current CitiBike users demonstrates a need to focus on marketing to these groups of people in order to grow appeal for the company and service.
